## OpenJS Foundation

About the OpenJS Foundation
The OpenJS Foundation is made up of 32 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Dojo, Electron, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

Thanks to the interconnected nature of the JavaScript ecosystem, our scope covers a broad range of projects that represent a massive and diverse developer and end user community.  While hosted projects will be our main focus, the benefits of the OpenJS Foundation will extend to non-hosted projects as well. Our goal is to make it easy and straightforward for projects to join the OpenJS Foundation and take advantage of our technical and community governance templates. In addition, companies that depend upon JavaScript are invited to join as members, providing tangible support and direction in activities that benefit the entire ecosystem.


OpenJS Foundation由32个开源JavaScript项目组成，这些项目包括Appium，Dojo，Electron，jQuery，Node.js和webpack。我们的使命是通过提供一个中立的组织来托管和维持项目，并共同资助有利于整个生态系统的活动，来支持JavaScript和Web技术的健康发展。

由于JavaScript生态系统具有相互联系的性质，因此我们的范围涵盖了代表庞大且多样化的开发人员和最终用户社区的广泛项目。虽然托管项目将是我们的主要重点，但OpenJS Foundation的好处也将扩展到非托管项目。我们的目标是使项目加入OpenJS基金会变得容易和直接，并利用我们的技术和社区治理模板。此外，还邀请依赖JavaScript的公司作为成员加入，为有益于整个生态系统的活动提供切实的支持和指导。
